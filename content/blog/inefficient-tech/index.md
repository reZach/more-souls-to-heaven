Technology isn't effective by being efficient.

## The never-ending cycle
We will have better frameworks. We will have faster computers. We will have smarter algorithms. We will have better hardware. We will have smarter hardware. Enhancements to technology drive lower costs and increased productivity, which leads to innovation and ideas that have not been feasible before. 

Year after year, we improve endlessly, always outdoing ourselves with our cunning and work ethic. This is good, we should continue to do so.

## All of this is for naught
None of the technology we create is important, because technology isn't an end, it's an means to an end. We forget this. Our to do apps aren't important. Our map apps aren't important. Our fitness apps aren't important. Our frameworks aren't important. Our hardware advances aren't important. Our "smart" AI isn't important. Our algorithms aren't important.

What's important is getting home in time for our wife's birthday. What's important is organizing our tasks so we don't waste our time. What's important is that we can securely check out and buy products online. What's important is we can provide low-cost tech to support developing countries.

Remember, our tech can be efficient as possible, but it's not effective unless we remember why we are building it in the first place.
