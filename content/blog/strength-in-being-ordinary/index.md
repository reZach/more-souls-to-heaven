description: God works through regular people

Yesterday was the first day we stepped into [the Bible in a Year podcast](https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/) and reflected on our first reading of Chronicles. The reading wasn't anything most readers would say was extraordinary or fascinating but the reflection on that passage made me think.

## A lot of ancestry
To those who are not familiar, Chronicles details the family history of those in the Bible, beginning with Adam and moving to Abraham, and then to Jacob, and so forth. To be honest, as I read Chronicles there were a lot of the names I had forgotten, so it shows how much more I can grow when it comes to knowing my Christian history!

While we may gloss over all of the names, there is an important focus we should reflect on.

## God works through ordinary people
Take a moment to think that with _regular_, _ordinary_ people God works His will into our lives. The longer you read the Bible, the more you begin to see that the people in the Bible are _ordinary_; people that God has chosen. Wow. That should really stop you in your tracks. If you are thinking that you need to be special or strong or talented or courageous or smart, know that with whatever talents and personality God has given you, He can work _anything_ in and through your life.
