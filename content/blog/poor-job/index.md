description: Why does God punish those who are good?

The story of Job in the Bible is a story about a righteous man who has his blessings taken away from him as God allows Satan to cause disruption and ill. We might ask, why does God allow this to happen to Job [or us]?

## A righteous man
Job is described as a righteous man, blameless before God. Job does everything the Lord wishes, but Satan believes that it is because Job has so many blessings; his children, livestock, etc. that are why Job has fear of the Lord, and without these things, Job would curse at the name of God. God agrees to let Satan take these things away from Job. In the beginning, Job knows these actions are from the Lord, but as time passes on, Job becomes increasingly bitter towards his situation.

We may have found or find ourselves in a similar situation; we try our best to do God's will but we are still suffering.

## Suffering strengthens us
The strong among us are not strong because we were born this way, but because we were tested and grew. So too does Jesus live out this example for us when He is tempted by Satan in the desert. In each of the three times Jesus was tempted, He called upon His father and His faith to stand firm. I believe in the same way, God allows suffering to fall us so that we remember His ultimate role and that we humble ourselves and ask for help from Him.

Suffering in this way helps us focus on our need of God, and a pathway for spiritual growth.

## Suffering is true love
To ask what is your passion is asking what are you willing to suffer for? Just as Jesus literally has His own passion (in the form of crucifixion), He invites us into this same suffering.

A great saint, Saint Teresa of Calcutta, spent decades serving the poor in India. While she appeared joyful, on the inside she felt spiritually barren. Saint Teresa did not feel God's love for _decades_ of her life. It bears the question why God chose to call her to serve but not be present to her.

People theororize that the absence of God brought Saint Teresa into the deeper mystery of Jesus's love for us, that is, His absence to her helped Saint Teresa understand Jesus's absence of God during the Passion. Jesus so deeply loved us that he died for us, but remember that He called out to God the father and asked that this cup be taken away from his lips, and yet still went through and died for us on the cross.

Let us pray today that the suffering God gives each one of us is used for our own spiritual benefit and the benefit of others.
