description: What is it about the heart of a woman that makes it so beautiful, and how can understanding a woman's heart lead us closer to Christ?

The heart of a woman teaches a man so many things:

How to be respectful  
How to listen  
How to be selfless  
How to love  
How to grow  
How to be strong  
How to provide  
How to nurture  
How to be patient  
How to be kind  
How to be responsible  
How to protect  
How to lead  
How to plan

## Jesus, as our guide
Jesus was born into poverty. He did not live his life with wealth or power (although he _did_ exercise his power). He lived his life as an example, of service and of giving.

Jesus taught us with his life that the greatest of lives are those of us who give of our time, energy and focus to others.

## Born men and woman
I can only assume, a woman wants a man like Jesus. She wants a man who serves others, one who exemplifies all of the attributes above. So, in order for us men to properly love women, we must come to imitate the life of Jesus and grow closer to Christ, for inspiration and strength along the way.
