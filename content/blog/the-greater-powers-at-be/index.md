description: How do we make sense of the antitrust hearings of the major tech players?
---

With the [antitrust hearings](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/antitrust-hearing-tech-ceos/index.html) going on today, it's a mixed bag of feelings. 

There are a lot of people who think that:
- Google steals your business's web traffic, putting small businesses out of the market
- Facebook censors content it doesn't agree with, inadvertenly creating bias
- Amazon steals the ideas of merchants who sell on Amazon, who at their scale is able to put them out of business by offering a cheaper product
- Apple desires an app marketplace monopoly due to their app store pricing practices

Whether or not these are true, will be up to our elected men and women in congress to decide and take action on.

## Do you feel hopeless?
If any of the accusations hold merit, it would seem like all of the cards are in the hands of few individuals. 

It can be very frustrating to believe that your desires or dreams might not be able to come to fruition based on things you can't control. Maybe you wanted to start a business. Maybe you feel you have bias portrayed about you online. Maybe you desired free and open market practices.

Of course, try. If you have a dream, you should pursue it. Don't believe that you can't be successful.

## Stop trying to win
If the limiting presence of the greater powers at be is too great for you to bear, stop. Be realistic with yourself: are _you_ yourself able to change anything? It's very likely you will always live under businesses or groups that seem to have all of the "power". Growing resentful, angry or vengeful under bigger players is not going to solve anything.

Why does this need to happen? Why do we have people or groups in our lives that hold us back without any ability for us to change our future?

## Step into faith
Know and come to believe that God is good, is all-powerful, and desires you to become the best person you were made to be. If God is allowing these companies market dominance, it is for good reason.

God so greatly desires you, more than you will ever know until you experience it firsthand. In His ways, God likes to initiate the conversation with you by making things seem impossible. Situations like these force us to remain angry, or to look to God for a solution/fix. 

What starts with us looking for a way to control our situation, slowly turns into faith that we don't need to be in control, and are in fact, not in control. With faith, comes humility and listening and responding to the events that God allows to happen.

Don't try to fix the world, but instead look at what situations you are put in and ask yourself how can this help shape me into a better version of myself. It is _all_ about perspective.
