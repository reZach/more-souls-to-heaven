There is a longing in every one of our hearts that can only be filled by Christ.

## We fill it with everything
We fill our hearts with accomplishments. We fill our hearts with love. We fill our hearts with food. We fill our hearts with friends. We fill our hearts with travel. None of these things make us feel _fulfilled_ and we long and live in constant agony for years upon years trying to find the next "thing" that fills us up.

## Christ can only fill our hearts
I like to use the analogy that our hearts are like a cup with a small hole in the bottom. We can put anything we want inside of the cup but it will eventually be emptied. 

In my life, I had been trying to fill this hole with relationships. I counted the years of relationships that never worked out and tried to be "steadfast" and wait for the right person to come along. Fortunately, I ended up becoming broken for having waited so long trying to find someone, and this is when I began to trust and believe in God and His plan for my life. This led me into a relationship with Christ and led me to prayer and adoration.

## Christ in the Eucharist[ic adoration]
As I spent more time at Eucharistic adoration, I found a certain comfort in myself when I was kneeling there, talking to God in my head and just trying to be present with Him. This comfort always left me once adoration was over, which led me to spend more time with Him every week.

One fateful night as I went to adoration again, I didn't feel I was becoming any closer between myself and God like I normally felt as I entered the church. Adoration was had, and mass began afterwards. During closing announcements a thought entered my heart that I should talk to the girl a few pews sitting in front of me - still in an effort to find fulfillment in relationships, but I dismissed the thought. A minute passed by and a wave of security and wholeness enveloped my heart.

The Holy Spirit came into my heart. God filled the needinness that Iâ€™ve been looking to other girls for. I no longer had any desire to look to girls to fill this emptiness I wanted to fill in my heart. God was in my heart and my relationship with Him was first. The feeling of being full in my heart shocked me, it was a safe and warm feeling.
