description: How weakness can be a strength
---

From time to time, we become aware that there are parts of ourselves that aren't as good or as sharp or as holy as we want or imagine them to be. It's never pleasant to bring attention to these things, but when this time comes, we can act in either one or two ways. We can feel _defeated_ or we can be _empowered_ and have hope.

## Do we admit defeat?
Do we blame our past, or past relationships for where things are now? Too often I think this is the default answer, I know I have certainly chosen this choice in my past.

## Or do we have hope?
Do we truly _believe_ that God works all things for our good, and if something is drawing our attention to our weaknesses, can we humbly admit them and see this as a desire that God is wishing/wanting for us to grow into better people? I am certainly in this camp today.

## God allows our weakness
God doesn't want us to be broken or hurt or weak. God wants us to live good, holy lives. However, God loves us so He allows us to choose brokenness, but this does not mean God no longer wants us whole.

In our weakness, God invites us to call to Him, to ask for help. God wants us to lean to Him, seek Him, search Him, desire Him. God desires our wholeness, and I think He uses our own weaknesses to guide us closer to Him.
